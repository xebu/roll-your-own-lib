# 🧪 Manual Testing — JavaScript Arithmetic

You're tasked with testing and fixing four basic arithmetic functions.

But here's the twist:

- ❌ You may **not use any test library** (no Jest, Mocha, etc.)
- ✅ You **must write all tests by hand**, directly in this file
- ✅ You are encouraged to invent your own helpers (e.g. `assertEqual`, `expect`, etc.)

Your job is to:
1. Write tests that reveal the bugs
2. Fix the broken functions
3. Improve your test readability as you go

💡 Run your file using: `node 01-manual-test.js`
